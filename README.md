# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

This is my first data analysis project using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. I explored a dataset of student scores to understand how various factors like **gender**, **parental education**, and **marital status** may influence academic performance.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ✅ **Gender Distribution**: There are more female students than male students in the dataset.
- 🎓 **Parental Education**: Students with educated parents tend to perform better academically.
- 💍 **Marital Status**: The marital status of parents has little to no observable impact on student scores.

## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used

- `Python 3`
- `Pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning
- `NumPy` for numerical operations
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes:
- Bar charts for gender distribution
- Line/box plots for comparing performance by parental education
- Statistical summaries using Pandas methods

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Drawing meaningful conclusions from visual patterns
- Creating plots with labels, titles, and legends

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains student-level data including gender, parental education, marital status, and scores.
